# Optimization

Lets solve optimization problem using this C codes. In this project, we firstly defined an engineering problem with objective function, variables, and constraints. Secondly, wrote it down to C program. We used Quasi Newton Method(BFGS) to find direction for optimization, and used "Equal interval section method" or "Golden Section method" or "Quadratic approximation method" to search initial interval and decide final interval reducing steps. My contribution to this code is following. -> function codes named "Equal interval section method", "Golden section method", "Quadratic approximation method" were fully coded by me.

[We referred algorithms and main ideas by a textbook, [Jasbir_S._Arora]_Introduction_to_optimum_design].
